In this post I'll go over my motivations for creating and maintaining this website, and how it compares to my old
website. I'll also go over the frameworks that I used to build it and the services that I use to have it accessible over
the internet.

# Table of Contents

# My Own Website!

I really love the idea of having my own personal space to express myself. This site is essentially some combination of a
side-project, a place to collect my other side projects, my professional portfolio, and a place to publish thoughts.

I also wanted to build everything myself to have control over every detail. I have complete control over the UI, and I
even chose a UI framework that lets me change as much as I want about the UI without being stuck to a certain "look"
(Something I don't really like about certain popular UI frameworks).

Although I'm not anti-platform, I like having ownership over my content without handing over everything to a platform if
it isn't necessary, I'm not looking for this to become viral or to have my content find users on it's own (In fact I've
blocked search indexing with a 'no-index' tag). I do use a hosting platform to host the site, but I'm not completely
beholden to them as I could just as easily throw the site onto a Raspberry Pi.

## Refreshing My Old Website

My old website, which you can find [here](https://old.kevs.tech) was written in plain HTML, using
[Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/) as it's CSS framework and a single CSS file with classes for specific
styling of components.

The best part about the old setup was that it loaded amazingly fast, given that it had almost no JavaScript except
anything that came with Materialize. Another advantage with this setup is that because it is just a collection of static
files it is very cheap to host because there is no backend required and it can just be served from a CDN. There are many
generous free-tier options available but I used Github Pages which just serves content from your repository for free.

One of the issues with this setup is that it was hard to scale the development of the site, all the markup is in a
single HTML file (1000+ lines), there isn't a component system, leading to repetitive markup. I was unhappy with
Materialize because I wanted a UI framework that was more customizable beyond color variations on the default look.
Lastly I also wanted to add a blog and a way to generate blog pages statically from Markdown files.

The rest of this post offers a look at the solution I arrived at for my website refresh.

## Domain

The world of domain registrars filled with companies that offer what look on the surface like amazing deals, only to
charge you extra past the second year, or up-charge for services that are essentially free on their end like hiding your
personal information from WHOIS lookups.

In any case I use [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) which charges a flat fee and doesn't up-sell on any basic
services like configuring DNS.

## Email Forwarding

Now that I have a domain, a great way to get immediate value out of it is to setup an email forwarder, which lets you
configure addresses using your domain to forward to your personal email. There are quite a few free providers for this
kind of service but usually **sending** email using the domain is offered as a paid service though.

I use [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/) since I liked the transparency they showed about their business, see their
[post on what data they log](https://improvmx.com/guides/what-do-we-log/) for example.

## Hosting

One advantage with going with a statically generated website (The compiled output is generated once at build and can be
served from a web server) is that serving the files have gotten really cheap for platforms that provide this service and
many offer generous free tiers or will just serve static content for free (For example Github Pages).

Netlify is a service specifically for statically generated sites and offers a generous free tier for hosting. It can
monitor your Github project for changes to build and deploy the newest version.

# Chakra UI



# NextJS for Static Generation

NextJS which is a React-based framework for building Statically Generated or Server-Side Rendered (SSR) applications. As
a framework it prescribes a particular way to build your application but in return it provides many helpful pre-built
components that you may need.

## Pages

By creating React Component files in the `pages` directory, NextJS will automatically generate a page with that
component and route it to the file path relative to `pages`. For example the `/pages/example.tsx` would map to
` /example` and `/pages/blog/index.tsx ` corresponds to the `/blog` page.

In each page, if data fetching is necessary we can implement a `getStaticProps` function, for example to get the list of
blog posts.

```Typescript
// Example from NextJS docs.
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Fetch data from external API
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
  const data = await res.json()

  return { props: { data } }
}
```
