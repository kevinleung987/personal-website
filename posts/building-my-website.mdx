In this post I'll go over my motivations for creating and maintaining this website, as well as how it compares to my old
website. I'll also go over the frameworks that I used to build it and the services that I use to make it accessible over
the internet.

# Table of Contents

# Why I Build My Own Website

I really love the idea of having my own personal website built from the ground up to express myself. This site is
essentially some combination of a side-project, a place to experiment, a professional portfolio, and a place to publish
my thoughts.

I wanted to build everything myself to have control over every detail. I also wanted to experiment with the UI
design-wise, for this reason I chose a UI framework that lets me change as much as I want about the UI without being
stuck to a certain "look" (Something I don't really like about some popular UI frameworks).

Although I'm not anti-platform, I like having ownership over my content without handing over control of everything to a
platform, I'm not looking for this to become viral or to have my content find users on it's own (In fact I've blocked
search indexing with a 'no-index' tag). I do use a hosting platform to host the site, but I'm not completely beholden to
them as I could just as easily throw the site onto a Raspberry Pi.

Writing the content of my blog posts in Markdown means that I can essentially transplant my posts to any other setup in
the future, whether I decide to use a different static site generator or build yet another website.

## Refreshing My Old Website

My old website, which you can find [here](https://old.kevs.tech) was written in plain HTML, using
[Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/) as it's CSS framework and a single CSS file with classes for specific
styling of components.

The best part about the old setup was that it loaded pretty quickly, given that it had almost no JavaScript except
anything that came with Materialize. Another advantage with this setup is that because it was just a collection of
static files it was very cheap to host because there is no backend required and it could just be served from a CDN.
There are many generous free-tier options available but I used Github Pages which just serves files from your repository
for free.

One of the issues with this setup is that it was hard to scale the development of the site, all the markup is in a
single HTML file (1000+ lines), there wasn't a component system, leading to repetitive markup. I was unhappy with
Materialize because I wanted a UI framework that was more customizable beyond color variations on the default look.
Lastly I wanted to add a blog and a way to generate blog pages statically from Markdown files.

So I set out into the world to take a look at what tools were available for a modern personal website, and the rest of
this post offers a look at the solution I arrived at.

## Domain Registration

The world of domain registrars filled with companies that offer what look on the surface like amazing deals, only to
charge you extra past the second year, or up-charge for services that are essentially free on their end like hiding your
personal information from WHOIS lookups.

In any case I use [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) which charges a flat fee and doesn't up-sell on any basic
services like configuring DNS.

## Email Forwarding

Now that we have a domain, a great way to get immediate value out of it is to setup an email forwarde, which lets you
configure addresses using your domain to forward to your personal email. There are quite a few free providers for this
kind of service but usually **sending** email using the domain is offered as a paid service.

I use [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/) since I liked the transparency they showed about their business, see their
[post on what data they log](https://improvmx.com/guides/what-do-we-log/) for example.

## Hosting

One advantage with going with a statically generated website (The compiled output is generated once at build and can be
served from a web server) is that serving the files have gotten really cheap for platforms that provide this service and
many offer generous free tiers or will just serve static content for free (For example Github Pages).

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a service specifically for statically generated sites and offers a generous free
tier for hosting. It can monitor your Github project for changes to build and deploy the newest version.

# React & TypeScript

I use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for my site. These are both
extremely popular tools in web development so I won't go too in-depth in this post.

React is a library for building declarative component based interfaces, it has many features for managing component
state, re-rendering subtrees of components when their properties change, and more. It comes with JSX which is it's own
syntax for describing the DOM.

```tsx
// props is passed down from a parent component
// if it ever changes, this Navbar would re-render.
return (
  <Navbar>
    {props.links.map((link) => (
      <Link href={link.href} onClick={navigate(link.href)} />
    ))}
  </Navbar>
);
```

TypeScript is a language that builds on top of JavaScript, it compiles down to JavaScript in the end and essentially
lets you write JavaScript with types, along with other extra syntax that the TypeScript compiler supports.

# Chakra UI

[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) is a React UI framework centered around building modern UI components while having
complete control over the look and feel of your application.

Where alot of popular frameworks will provide default components for large parts of your application like the Navbar or
Card components, Chakra UI only provides the essentials, essentially just wrappers on top of the base HTML tags, with
helper properties and theme variables (Like for font sizes or colors).

It provides a simple API surface and doesn't force you into a specific aesthetic, you're meant to compose your own
components and style them yourself. Only the most basic components like Buttons are provided and the default theme, I
think of it like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) but for React.

It also comes with an icon library and animations through [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), here's an
example of the container `<Box>` component used in the blog index page. We can describe vertical margin with helpers
like `my` and use font size variables like `lg` to set the size of the `box-shadow`. Hooks like `useColorModeValue` let
us set specific colors based on the user's Light/Dark mode.

```tsx
<Box
  mx="auto"
  my="6"
  px="8"
  py="4"
  rounded="lg"
  shadow="lg"
  bg={useColorModeValue("white", "gray.900")}
  maxW="3xl"
  cursor="pointer"
  whileHover={{
    translateY: -4,
    transition: { duration: 0.25 },
  }}
  onClick={() => router.push(href)}
/>
```

# NextJS for Static Generation

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) is a React-based framework for building **Statically Generated** or **Server-Side
Rendered** (SSR) applications. As a framework it forces me to structure my application in a certain way but in return it
provides many helpful features for statically generated sites.

I went for the static generation route, which means the output files are compiled once at build time and served from a
CDN or any other web server. Because you only need to serve static files, a persistent backend server isn't required and
it has gotten very cheap to serve static files in recent years so many platforms offer generous free tiers.

NextJS also comes with development goodies like ESLint, TypeScript, and Fast Refresh for development builds built in,
this makes development a breeze.

## Pages

By creating React component files in the `pages` directory, NextJS will automatically generate a page with that
component and route it to path corresponding it. For example `/pages/example.tsx` would map to `/example` and
`/pages/blog/index.tsx ` corresponds to the `/blog` page (This is because we also have `[slug].tsx` in the same
directory so we have a component that represents the index page).

In each page, if data fetching is necessary we can implement a `getStaticProps` function which can be run when the page
is statically generated to provide data. This is **not** code that runs on the client, it is run on a server when the
application is built (Usually triggered by a push to the Github repo).

```tsx
function Example({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {data.map((foo) => (
        <p>{foo.bar}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Fetch data from external API, this could also be a file system read or any other data fetching.
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`);
  const data = await res.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}
```

## Static Export & Pre-fetching

Lets take a look at how NextJS helps us with serving static files that have a quick load time.

After building with NextJS I get a static export in my output directory that looks like this, with hashes replaced with
`%`:

```markup
├── 404.html
├── blog
|  ├── building-my-website.html
├── blog.html
├── experience.html
├── favicon.ico
├── index.html
├── logo.png
├── projects.html
└── _next
   ├── data
   |  └── %%%%%%%%%%%%
   |     ├── blog
   |     |  ├── building-my-website.json
   |     └── blog.json
   └── static
      ├── chunks
      |  ├── 346-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  ├── framework-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  ├── main-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  ├── pages
      |  |  ├── blog
      |  |  ├── blog-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  |  ├── experience-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  |  ├── index-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  |  ├── projects-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  |  ├── _app-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  |  └── _error-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  ├── polyfills-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      |  └── webpack-%%%%%%%%%%%%.js
      ├── css
      |  └── %%%%%%%%%%%%.css
      ├── media
      |  ├── Bunch of Fonts
```

Hosted on a web server, this essentially allows any of the `.html` files to serve as entry-points into the app, these
point to the necessary chunks needed to get the NextJS framework running and all the content for that page. Once the app
has been loaded, navigating to other pages only requires that the app loads the `.js` chunks needed for that page. In
the case of any pages that require data-fetching, the data also needs to be loaded in.

For simple pages this can be a small amount of data but for more complex pages that might have external dependencies,
this could be a sizable amount of data that needs to be fetched on load. One way NextJS solves this is by prefetching
resources for other pages that can be navigated to from the user's current page.

When a `<Link>` component is rendered, it will prefetch the chunks relevant to that page, however because we're using
Chakra UI which has it's own `<Link>` component, we need to wrap them together like so:

```tsx
<NextLink href="/blog" passHref>
  <Link>Blog</Link>
</NextLink>
```

Prefetching essentially gives us the performance and feel of a **Single Page Application** (An application where
everything necessary to render any of it's pages is already loaded) but the load-time of a static one. For example, you
can load into the homepage of the site, and the browser will initially only fetch what is necessary to render it, and
once that is complete it will start prefetching the data for any other pages corresponding to the `<Link>` components on
the page.

# Blog Posts in NextJS with MDX

I wanted to write the content of my posts in Markdown and let NextJS generate the content of each page, this means that
the actual content of the blogs is separate from the UI. If I ever decided that I wanted to move the content elsewhere
or change how the blog posts look, alot less work would need to be done.

While Markdown is great for text, it doesn't support custom embedded UI elements, for example a video player or custom
UI widgets. Luckily I can use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which lets me embed React components into the content of the
posts.

There's quite a few pieces that fit together in order to process these MDX files into a NextJS page, let's take a look
at the code to that reads the files and processes them initially:

```ts:utils/blog.ts
const updateCache = () => {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(path.join(process.cwd(), POSTS_DIR));
  cache = files.map((fileName) => {
    const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), POSTS_DIR, fileName);
    const slug = fileName.replace(/\.mdx/, "");
    const source = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
    const { data, content } = matter(source);
    const time = readingTime(content).text;
    return {
      slug,
      time,
      content,
      frontMatter: data as FrontMatter,
    };
  });
};
```

First, the `fs` module from Node is used to read from the file system to get all the `.mdx` files in our `posts`
directory.

After that, the `gray-matter` library is used to separate the "front-matter", which is read into `data`, from the
regular content of the blog post which is stored into `content`, this is essentially metadata that is embedded at the
top of each blog post that lets us specify things like the `title`.

```yaml
---
title: Example Post
description: Example Description
date: "2021-07-21"
published: false
tags:
  - example
---
```

After that I use a library to count the number of words in the post to estimate the reading time. This is all stored in
a cache because other functions fetching blog data at build time will need to access the same information.

Now that we have our MDX content available in our code and any other metadata we needed, let's take a look at how we can
render it in React.

If you'll recall from earlier, NextJS will generate routes for our `.tsx` files placed in `/pages/`, but we can also
have wildcard pages which support multiple paths (Defined by `getStaticPaths`).

```tsx:/pages/blog/[slug].tsx
// Component that renders the blog content.
<MDXRemote {...mdxSource} components={MDXComponents} />

// getStaticPaths defines the valid paths for this wildcard. (not shown)

// getStaticProps which fetches data for the page.
const post = getPostBySlug(params.slug);
  if (post == null) {
    throw new Error();
  }

  const mdxSource = await serialize(post.content, {
    mdxOptions: {
      remarkPlugins: [
        require("remark-slug"),
        require("remark-code-titles"),
        require("remark-toc"),
      ],
      rehypePlugins: [require("mdx-prism")],
    },
  });
  return {
    props: {
      mdxSource,
      time: post.time,
      frontMatter: post.frontMatter,
    },
  };
```

I use the `next-remote-mdx` library which provides the `serialize` function to process everything and the
`<MDXRemote />` React component to render the content. These are essentially helpers for using MDX inside NextJS.

MDX uses `remark` which is a Markdown processor and we can use plugins like `remark-slug` to add ID tags to every
heading which means they can be jumped to from the Table of Contents (Which is generated by `remark-toc`), and any code
blocks are optionally annotated with the title of the file using `remark-code-titles`.

MDX also uses `rehype` which is an HTML processor that lets us format the output of our MDX. I use this to power syntax
highlighting for code blocks through the `mdx-prism` plugin.

After all this processing, the end result is passed to `<MDXRemote />` which renders the content. We can replace the
HTML tags it outputs using a mapping of tags to React components which I defined in `MDXComponents`.

These are used to tell it what it needs to render for each corresponding tag. This is also where I would define any
custom components that might show up in the MDX content, so it would know for example that encountering `<Component />`
in the MDX content it would need to render the `<Component foo={bar} />` React component.

Below you can find an excerpt of this, showing a mapping of Markdown/HTML tags to components from Chakra UI.

```ts
const MDXComponents = {
  p: (props: any) => <Text fontSize="lg" my="3" {...props} />,
  h1: (props: any) => <Heading fontSize="3xl" my="3" {...props} />,
  h2: (props: any) => <Heading fontSize="2xl" my="3" {...props} />,
  h3: (props: any) => <Heading fontSize="xl" my="3" {...props} />,
  ...
}
```

You can find an example post that I created to test the completeness of my mapping to MDX [here](./example).

The ecosystem around using Markdown to generate blogs is surprisingly mature, and alternative Static Site Generators
like Jekyll operate entirely on this principle.

# Conclusion

Before this rewrite of my personal website (Which was in plain HTML) I had never touched any of the technologies or
libraries above except for React and TypeScript, and it turned out to be a great opportunity to see what the state of
the world is like for building a modern personal website.

Overall I'm very pleased with how the site has turned out, and it feels like a great foundation for future content and
experimentation.

I hope you enjoyed this technical dive into what I thought were the interesting parts of building this site!
