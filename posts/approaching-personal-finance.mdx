title: Approaching Personal Finance
description:
  Many of my peers are at the age where they're going out into the world and making real money for the first time in
  their lives and some have been asking for my advice on how to best handle their personal finances. I've decided to lay
  out my ideas in this post, with the goal of exploring my thinking on how I approach personal finance as well as
  discussing many options for structuring your finances.

One issue I had growing up in the Canadian education system was that personal finance was a subject I basically never
came across in formal education. From talking to my peers their experience was essentially the same, all our knowledge
leading up to entering the workforce came from apocryphal information from our parents or adults in our lives that was
often either incomplete like "never use a credit-card because it's a scheme to entrap you in debt" or outdated like
"keep an emergency fund in cash so when there's a run on the banks you can access your funds".

# Part II: Structuring Your Finances

When I say "structure" of your finances I really mean where your money goes or how you spend it, this essentially breaks
down into three categories:

- Spending
  - Spending Account
  - Credit
- Saving
  - Emergency Fund
  - Liquid Investments
- Investing
  - Tax Advantaged Accounts
  - Brokerage Accounts
  - Real Estate
  - Others

I'm not saying you need everything on here, but for each item I'll describe it, give some thoughts and list some things
to look out for when choosing an option.

For every item listed, [Nerdwallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/) is usually a good bet to find reviews on different
financial services. For example you can browse Nerdwallet to compare interest rates between bank accounts.

## Spending

### Spending Account

This is essentially an deposit account where you can freely deposit and withdraw money from, usually this is offered in
the form of a "Checking Account", but the reason I call this part the "Spending Account" is because there are
increasingly deposit account offerings that yield interest, give cash-back when you spend, or have other benefits. For
example, the M1 Finance Spending account lets you divert excess deposits towards your investments (Unfortunately
unavailable currently to visa holders like myself).

The idea with the Spending Account is that you can pay off your credit card, transfer money to other people or your
other accounts, all without incurring any fees and with few limits.

The amount you keep here is up to you, but I typically aim for 2 months worth of expenses. But if I foresee any larger
expenses coming up I may keep a larger amount.

The kinds of features you should consider are its fees, minimum balance, transaction limits, branch and ATM
availability. Its generally a tradeoff between these and what you prioritize is up to you. Personally I went for a
no-fee, no minimum balance and no restriction account that doesn't have much in-person branch support.

Currently, there are many "Online Bank" offerings with zero fees and some even throw in some interest (0.30% - 1.00%).
Some financial technology companies like M1 and Robinhood have spending account options attached to their investment
accounts which lets you earn interest on uninvested cash.

### Credit

To start with, its generally a terrible idea to pay interest on luxury items and other expenses that don't hold their
value or depreciate over time. But, there are still good ways to effectively benefit from spending on things on credit,
with the intent to pay little to no interest. Like we discussed earlier about the "time-value of money", it can actually
be a good idea to accept financing offers with promotional low or no interest rates because you can benefit from keeping
more of your money now, and spreading out the impact of the expense.

In general a true 0% interest rate with no strings attached can be a great deal, although very rare, sometimes you can
find this when financing expensive luxury goods like Peloton through lending services like Affirm, typically the actual
interest paid to the lender is subsidized in order to get a 0% rate and entice more business.

An interest rate at or below inflation can be very good way to get more time-value out of your money, typically you'll
find these with secured lending options, like buying securities on margin, where your existing investments are used as
collateral.

The "prime rate" (Currently 2.45% for Canada, 3.25% in US) is used by banks for lending to customers with excellent
credit, typically for Mortgage loans. In our current low interest-rate environment, this can be an excellent deal for
real-estate investing, although getting a loan at or near the prime rate usually requires great credit.

The typical credit card rate (12% - 25%)

By utilizing your credit, you can improve your credit score and get better credit offerings in the future, for example a
more exclusive credit card or lower interest rate on a loan or mortgage. Credit Scores are a bit of a grey-box, while
some of their components are known (credit utilization, age of credit, etc) the computed result can be a bit difficult
to retrieve. In fact, having your credit report generated can actually decrease your credit score ðŸ¤”. A great way to
keep track of your credit score without a hard credit pull is through [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/),
which is available in the US and Canada.
